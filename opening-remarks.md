~Things to cover during opening remarks

* Welcome to Code for DC!
* What is Code for DC?
* Show of hands/whose first time is it?
* Show of hands/whose second time is it?
    * We are an all-volunteer group that tries to make DC better through the lens of the web, data, and technology.
    * We are non-profit and non-partisan
    * This is a safe space and all are welcome here.  Please be respectful and take a look at our code of conduct.
    * This is a collaborative environment! If you have ideas for how to make Code for DC better, don't be shy.  

* Tonight we're going to break into projects and anyone can join a project they find compelling.
* For new people or anyone who wants a refresher, we'll be doing an orientation class first.
* So, let's go around the room and introduce our projects.
* {{projects get introduced by whoever wants to introduce them.}}
* So what happens now is this: people who already have a project will go ahead and get started.
    * If you're new, stay put and we'll get you oriented.
* After orientation, new folks can join projects, and then we'll all hack until about 8:45.
* At 8:45, we'll reconvene to talk about what we accomplished, then we'll declare victory, and head to happy hour.
